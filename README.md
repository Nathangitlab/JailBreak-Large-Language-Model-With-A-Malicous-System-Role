# JailBreak-Large-Language-Model-With-A-Malicous-System-Role
We present a novel method that can jailbreak large language models with a malicious system role. It releases the potentially unethical or illegal intention of leveraging a large language model, like ChatGPT, to breach the security measures put in place to limit its access and permissions within a controlled environment. The intention behind this act may involve exploiting the model's capabilities for unauthorized access, spreading harmful information, or engaging in malicious activities. It is crucial to emphasize that engaging in such actions is unethical and illegal, as it violates privacy, intellectual property rights, and societal norms.
